# Security Advisory: CVE-2024-24762

## Vulnerability Details

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-24762
**Severity:** High (CVSS 7.5)
**Affected Components:**
- python-multipart < 0.0.7
- FastAPI < 0.109.1

**Description:**
This vulnerability is a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in the python-multipart library used by FastAPI for parsing HTTP Content-Type headers when reading form data. An attacker can cause a denial of service by sending a specially crafted Content-Type header that leads to excessive CPU consumption, stalling the main event loop and preventing the processing of further requests.

## Remediation

### Fixed Versions
The following versions contain patches for this vulnerability:
- python-multipart >= 0.0.7
- FastAPI >= 0.109.1

### Changes Made
The `requirements.txt` file has been updated to include the patched versions of the affected packages:
```
fastapi==0.109.1  # Updated from 0.104.1 to fix CVE-2024-24762
uvicorn[standard]==0.24.0
pydantic==2.5.0
python-multipart==0.0.7  # Secure version that fixes the ReDoS vulnerability
python-dotenv==1.0.0
```

## Deployment Instructions

To ensure your application is secure:

1. Update your dependencies using:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Restart your application after the update.

## Verification

After updating, you can verify that the secure versions are installed by running:
```
pip show fastapi python-multipart
```

## Additional Notes

The update from FastAPI 0.104.1 to 0.109.1 should be backward compatible with the current codebase, with no breaking changes that would affect this application.

Even if your application does not directly use Form or File handling from FastAPI, the vulnerability could still be exploited through specially crafted requests to any endpoint in your application.
